<p> <h1> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CARNIVAL IN ST. CROIX </span></h1></p>

<body>
<p>Growing up on the tropical island of St. Croix, U.S.V.I., I was always immersed with
various cultural experinces. For instance, every year, there is a big party called
Carnival. Carnival is an island-wide event that celebrates the unqiue culture of 
the island. Everyone spends months preparing for the event as it brings in the 
most tourism revenue of any other event on the island.</p><p> There are many different 
ways for the people of the island to particapte in Carnival. Many fisherman
showcase unique dishes with their fresh catch, and many women make delicous pastries out 
of local fruits such as guava and mango. Local artists create jewelry with shells
and seaglass. School bands plan their marches, and the famous carnival parade dancers
spend months designing and sewing elaborate costumes with feathers and jewels. However,
the mocko jumbies bring everything together. Men, women and children perch
high up on stilts and dress in bright colors and masks.</p><p> As a partipant in carvial,
I got to experince all the splendor of being high up on stilts. I practiced for weeks,
walking all around my house six feet above the ground, trying my best to balance. Finally, 
the big night came, and once my costume was on, I felt invicible. I danced all night long, and
seeing the joy on childrens faces as they looked up at me in awe is a feeling I will 
never forget. I <del>liked</del> <ins>LOVED</ins> being a part of something bigger 
than myself and so cultually rich.</p>
